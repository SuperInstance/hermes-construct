## 🔴 Critical Security Fixes (merge NOW)

| Commit | Description | Conflicts? |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `4e9d886` | Fix approval: pair terminal-side gate for ~/.hermes/config.yaml writes | None |
| `8f2931e` | Fix file_tools: block agent writes to ~/.hermes/config.yaml — prevent silent approval bypass | None |

These prevent an agent from silently modifying its own config to bypass approval gates. **Merge these two commits immediately**, even if we defer the rest.

## Recommended Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Security (do now)
```bash
git cherry-pick 4e9d886 8f2931e
```

### Phase 2: Bug fixes (this week)
```bash
git cherry-pick b964627 023149f ba6ffd4 6c73e8f 3ccf4fd 521d069 fb1b681 e8827ef b3aaf26 f106e58 bdceedf b14e15c
```

### Phase 3: Full merge (after testing)
```bash
git merge upstream/main
# Resolve .env.example conflict manually
# Test: cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
# Test: python cli.py --help
```

### Phase 4: Integrate features we want
- Dashboard (b571ec2) — review after we decide on UI direction
- Blank-slate skills (2ed9637) — aligns with module system
- Skill pruning (70e1571) — useful for self-configuring agent
- Undo/rewind (0622a70, 3e59be0) — good UX

## Conflict Resolution

Only `.env.example` conflicts. Both sides added API key placeholders. Resolution:

```bash
# Keep our ensign + deployment keys, add upstream's new keys
git checkout --ours .env.example
# Then manually add any new keys from upstream that we want
```
